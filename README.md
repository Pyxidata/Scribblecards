<h1>
  Description
</h1>

<p>
  Scribblecards is a flashcard application with a built-in drawing pad for writing out words. 
  Writing out the answer by hand encourages active recall with diverse stimuli, boosting memorization more than solely relying on visual guess-and-check. 
  Flashcards can either be manually created or be imported from spreadsheets. 
  Users can also copy list of questions and answers found from other online study materials, and paste the raw text to convert them into flashcards.
</p>

<p>
  The application keeps track of your mastery level for each deck of flashcards, reflecting both transient memory loss and reinforced memory through spaced repetition. 
  Various customizations are also available, such as difficulty options and flipping questions and answers. 
  Slots for hints and examples are also available to guide your study. 
  Korean option is available as well.
